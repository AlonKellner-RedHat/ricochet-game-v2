**Regression Test Policy:** After implementing Stage N, run ALL tests from Stages 1 through N. The full test suite must pass before proceeding to Stage N+1. No exceptions.

**Feedback Loop Protocol (applies to every stage):**
1. AI implements the stage (code + unit tests).
2. AI runs all unit tests (new + all prior). All must pass.
3. User performs interactive tests from the checklist.
4. User provides feedback (pass/fail per item + notes on unexpected behavior).
5. AI converts any failing interactive tests into automated tests.
6. AI applies fixes and re-runs all tests.
7. Repeat steps 3--6 until all checks pass.
8. Stage is marked complete. Proceed to next stage.

**USER VALIDATION GATE (MANDATORY)**

No stage is complete until the user has personally verified every interactive test item and provided explicit sign-off. After every behavioral feature (not just infrastructure), the user must SEE the behavior working in the running game before the stage is marked complete.

1. User MUST test every interactive test item marked with `[ ]`.
2. User MUST provide written pass/fail feedback for EACH item.
3. Any "fail" or "unexpected behavior" becomes a NEW automated test before proceeding.
4. AI MUST NOT proceed to the next stage until ALL interactive items are `[x]`.
5. The user's word is final. If the user says it doesn't look right, it doesn't ship.

## Stage 61: Basic Level Editor -- Surface Placement

### Overview
Introduce the level editor scene with core surface placement tools. The editor supports click-based creation of line segments (2 clicks: start, end) and arc segments (3 clicks: start, end, via), deletion of surfaces, and drag-based endpoint repositioning. Surface IDs use a monotonically incrementing counter that is persisted in the level file and never reused, ensuring stable references across edits.

### Prerequisites
Stage 60 (full game loop, level loading, menus, save system -- all gameplay systems complete).

### What Is Introduced

| Category | Item | Spec Reference |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Scene | `scenes/editor/editor.tscn` -- main editor scene with viewport, toolbar, and surface canvas | §19.2 |
| Script | `scripts/editor/editor_main.gd` -- editor scene controller, mode management | §19.2 |
| Script | `scripts/editor/surface_placer.gd` -- click-based surface creation (line: 2 clicks, arc: 3 clicks) | §19.2 |
| Script | `scripts/editor/surface_selector.gd` -- select, delete, move/resize surfaces | §19.2 |
| Script | `scripts/editor/editor_surface_renderer.gd` -- renders surfaces in editor using same color-coding as gameplay | §19.2 |
| Behavior | Line surface placement: click start point, click end point (2 clicks) | §19.2 |
| Behavior | Arc surface placement: click start, click end, click via (3 clicks) | §19.2 |
| Behavior | Delete surface: select and press Delete key | §19.2 |
| Behavior | Move/resize: drag endpoints; via stays at absolute position, carrier recomputed; if via no longer valid, editor snaps to nearest valid position | §19.2 |
| Behavior | Surface IDs: monotonically incrementing counter persisted in level file, never reused | §19.2 |

### Unit Tests Added

1. **`test_stage61_line_placement_two_clicks`**: Simulate two clicks at (100, 200) and (300, 200). Expected: a line surface is created with `start == Vector2(100, 200)` and `end == Vector2(300, 200)`, carrier `is_line() == true`. Validates: 2-click line creation.
2. **`test_stage61_arc_placement_three_clicks`**: Simulate three clicks at (100, 200), (300, 200), (200, 100). Expected: an arc surface is created with the three points, carrier `is_line() == false`, and all three points evaluate to ~0 on the carrier. Validates: 3-click arc creation, S11.
3. **`test_stage61_surface_id_monotonic`**: Create 5 surfaces in sequence. Expected: each surface ID is strictly greater than the previous. Validates: monotonic counter.
4. **`test_stage61_surface_id_never_reused`**: Create 3 surfaces (IDs 1, 2, 3), delete surface 2, create a new surface. Expected: new surface ID is 4 (not 2). Validates: IDs never reused.
5. **`test_stage61_delete_surface`**: Create a surface, select it, delete it. Expected: surface is removed from the editor's surface list. Surface count decreases by 1. Validates: deletion works.
6. **`test_stage61_move_endpoint_recomputes_carrier`**: Create a line surface, drag the end point to a new position. Expected: carrier is recomputed from new three-point configuration. Old carrier != new carrier. Validates: move updates geometry.
7. **`test_stage61_arc_via_stays_absolute_on_move`**: Create an arc surface with via at (200, 100). Move the start point. Expected: via position is still (200, 100) in absolute coordinates. Carrier is recomputed. Validates: via stability.
8. **`test_stage61_invalid_via_snaps`**: Create an arc surface. Move start point such that via becomes collinear with start and end. Expected: editor snaps via to the nearest valid (non-collinear) position. Validates: degenerate recovery.
9. **`test_stage61_surface_rendering_matches_gameplay`**: Create a surface with Reflection effect. Expected: rendered color in editor matches the Reflection color used in gameplay. Validates: visual consistency.
10. **`test_stage61_id_counter_persisted`**: Create surfaces (counter reaches 5), save level, reload. Create another surface. Expected: new ID is 6 (counter was persisted). Validates: counter persistence.

### Interactive User Tests

- [ ] Open the editor from the main menu. The editor scene loads with an empty canvas, toolbar visible.
- [ ] Select "Line" tool, click at one point, then click at another. A line surface appears between the two points.
- [ ] Select "Arc" tool, click start, click end, click via. A curved arc surface appears passing through all three points.
- [ ] Click on a surface to select it. Selection is visually indicated (highlight or handles at endpoints).
- [ ] Press Delete with a surface selected. The surface disappears.
- [ ] Drag an endpoint of a line surface. The surface stretches/moves accordingly.
- [ ] Drag an endpoint of an arc surface. The arc updates; the via point remains at its absolute position.
- [ ] Create and delete multiple surfaces. Verify that new surfaces always get higher IDs than any previously used (check via inspector or debug output).
- [ ] Surfaces are rendered with the same effect-based color coding as in gameplay.

### Invariants That Must Hold

| S17 | Provenance IDs unique | Unit test: surface IDs are unique and never reused | Inherited |

### Regression Checklist

| Prior Stage | Behavior | How to Verify |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Stage 60 | Full game loop: main menu -> level select -> play -> pause -> back | Play through a level |
| Stage 60 | Save/load game progress | Save, quit, reload, verify progress |
| Stage 59 | Camera tracking follows player/arrow | Play a level, observe camera |
| Stage 58 | HUD displays shot count, divergence status | Play a level, observe HUD |

### Interactive User Tests

- [ ] Create a zero-length surface (start == end). It is immediately highlighted in red.
- [ ] Assign Reflection to a circle carrier surface. Surface is highlighted in red with a tooltip or error indicator.
- [ ] Assign CircleInversion to a line carrier surface. Surface is highlighted in red.
- [ ] Fix the invalid surface (e.g., change effect to one compatible with carrier). Red highlight disappears in real-time.
- [ ] Attempt to save a level with invalid surfaces. Save is blocked; error list is shown.
- [ ] Fix all errors, save again. Save succeeds.
- [ ] Open cache override panel. Define a cycle with two surfaces and an expected identity result. Validation runs and shows pass/fail.
- [ ] Define a cache override with an intentionally wrong expected result. Validation shows discrepancy error with numeric details.
- [ ] Delete a surface referenced by a cache override. A warning dialog appears.
- [ ] Press "Test" button. The editor enters test mode: player appears at spawn, surfaces are interactive.
- [ ] In test mode, move with WASD, aim with mouse, fire (left click). Arrow travels and bounces correctly.
- [ ] Press Escape or a "Back to Editor" button. Returns to editing mode. No test-mode changes persist.

## Stage 64: Test Levels for Worked Examples

### Overview
Create four or more test levels that replicate the worked examples from §16. Each level includes hardcoded expected outputs (step coordinates, step types, bounce points) and automated comparison tests that trace the level at specified player/cursor positions and verify the output matches the expected values. This stage transforms the specification's worked examples into executable regression tests.

### Prerequisites
Stage 63 (editor with validation -- levels can be created and validated), Stage 60 (full trace/game system for automated testing).

### Unit Tests Added

1. **`test_stage64_s16_1_two_mirror_reflection`**: Load `test_s16_1_two_mirror.tres`. Surface A: vertical line at x=100 with left=Reflection. Surface B: horizontal line at y=100 with right=Reflection. Target T. Player at (50, 450). Fire toward mirror A. Expected: trace produces Reflection step off A, then Reflection step off B, then hits target T. Step coordinates match §16.1 expected values within epsilon. Validates: §16.1.
2. **`test_stage64_s16_1_step_types`**: Same level. Expected: all steps are `StepType.ALIGNED` (no divergence in simple reflection). Validates: step type assignment.
3. **`test_stage64_s16_2_circle_inversion`**: Load `test_s16_2_circle_inversion.tres`. Surface C: circle r=100 at (200, 200) with left=CircleInversion. Player at (50, 200). Fire toward circle. Expected: trace produces CircleInversion step. Output ray direction inverted through the circle. Step coordinates match §16.2 within epsilon. Validates: §16.2.
4. **`test_stage64_s16_2_carrier_is_circle`**: Same level. Expected: Surface C carrier `is_line() == false`, center == (200, 200), radius == 100. Validates: S11.
5. **`test_stage64_s16_3_divergence`**: Load `test_s16_3_divergence.tres`. Mirror M at x=200 (left=Reflection) + Wall W at x=150 (Block). Player at (50, 300). Plan includes M, but W blocks the path. Expected: divergence is detected. Step type includes `DIVERGED_PHYSICAL`. The physical trace hits W (Block) before reaching M. Validates: §16.3.
6. **`test_stage64_s16_3_block_stops_arrow`**: Same level. Expected: the arrow is stopped by the Block wall W. No steps beyond W. Validates: UX9.
7. **`test_stage64_s16_4_projective_break`**: Load `test_s16_4_projective.tres`. M1 at x=100 (Reflection), P at x=250 (LineNormalProjection), M2 at x=400 (Reflection). Expected: trace shows Reflection off M1, Projection at P (resets frame), Reflection off M2. Frame reset is visible in step data. Validates: §16.4, S10.
8. **`test_stage64_s16_4_frame_reset`**: Same level. Expected: frame after P is the identity frame (projective resets frame). Step at P has `step_type` involving projection. Validates: S10.
9. **`test_stage64_s16_5_double_hit`**: Load `test_s16_5_double_hit.tres`. Same mirror planned twice. Expected: first hit is planned, second hit occurs in a subsequent step (the mirror is hit again). Both hits are visible. Validates: §16.5.
10. **`test_stage64_s16_6_state_change`**: Load `test_s16_6_state_change.tres`. Breakable wall + target behind it. Expected: first shot breaks the wall (state change). Second shot passes through broken wall and hits target. State change is recorded. Validates: §16.6, S19.
11. **`test_stage64_all_levels_load_without_errors`**: Load all 6 test levels. Expected: all load successfully, validation passes for each. Validates: editor serialization correctness.
12. **`test_stage64_S3_determinism_per_level`**: For each test level, run the trace twice with identical inputs. Expected: both runs produce identical step trees. Validates: S3.
13. **`test_stage64_cache_override_affects_trace`**: Create a test level with a 4-mirror cycle where floating-point composition produces a near-identity but not exact identity. Add a CycleOverride declaring the composition = identity. Trace a ray through the cycle. Verify the trace uses the override (exact identity) rather than the computed value. Compare with a trace without the override to confirm different (incorrect) results without it. Validates: §17.4 manual overrides actually matter in gameplay tracing.
14. **`test_stage64_all_effects_level`**: Load `test_all_effects.tres`. Trace through it at several known positions. All effects interact correctly — no NaN, no crash, step tree is valid. Validates: cross-effect interaction in a realistic level with every effect type.
15. **`test_stage64_cache_override_in_planned_trace`**: The all-effects test level has a CycleOverride. Run both planned and physical traces through the cycle. Both should use the override. Validates: §17.4 overrides apply to planned traces, not just physical.

### Interactive User Tests

- [ ] Load `test_s16_1_two_mirror.tres` in the editor's test mode. Fire toward the first mirror. Arrow bounces off both mirrors and hits the target. Level completes.
- [ ] Load `test_s16_2_circle_inversion.tres`. Fire toward the circle. Arrow's path is inverted through the circle. Visual confirms the curved-to-straight (or vice versa) transformation.
- [ ] Load `test_s16_3_divergence.tres`. Plan to hit mirror M, but wall W is in the way. Preview shows divergence (red/orange path segments). Arrow hits the wall and stops.
- [ ] Load `test_s16_4_projective.tres`. Arrow bounces off M1, projects at P, bounces off M2. Frame reset at P is visually apparent (preview color or style change).
- [ ] Load `test_s16_5_double_hit.tres`. Plan the same mirror twice. Arrow bounces off the mirror, travels, and hits the mirror again. Both hits are visible in the preview.
- [ ] Load `test_s16_6_state_change.tres`. First shot hits breakable wall -- wall breaks. Second shot passes through and hits target. Level completes.
- [ ] Run full GUT suite. All worked example tests pass alongside all prior tests.

### Regression Checklist

| Prior Stage | Behavior | How to Verify |

## Stage 65: Invariant Sweep Testing

### Overview
This is the most critical testing stage in the entire project. Implement a grid sweep that tests ALL 29 invariants across 160,000 player-position/cursor-position combinations per test level (20x20 player grid times 20x20 cursor grid), plus custom near-degenerate positions. Every invariant that has been introduced across Stages 1--64 must now be fully and automatically verified at scale. Failures produce detailed reports with full context for debugging.

The sweep includes 7 test levels: the 6 worked-example levels (§16.1-16.6) plus the all-effects test level from Stage 64.

### Prerequisites
Stage 64 (test levels exist with known-good configurations), Stage 60 (all game systems complete -- all 29 invariants are implementable and testable).

### What Is Introduced

| Category | Item | Spec Reference |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Script | `tests/test_stage65_invariant_sweep.gd` -- grid sweep test harness | §29.3 |
| Script | `scripts/testing/invariant_checker.gd` -- checks all 29 invariants for a given (player_pos, cursor_pos, plan) configuration | §29.3 |
| Script | `scripts/testing/sweep_reporter.gd` -- generates detailed failure reports | §29.3 |
| Behavior | 20x20 player grid x 20x20 cursor grid = 160,000 combinations per level | §29.3 |
| Behavior | Custom positions: per-level `test_positions` array (surface endpoints, near-degenerate points) used as BOTH additional player AND cursor positions | §29.3 |
| Behavior | All 29 invariants checked at every combination | §29.3 |
| Behavior | Failure report: first failure with full context (player pos, cursor pos, plan, which invariant, actual vs expected) | §29.3 |

### Unit Tests Added

1. **`test_stage65_sweep_s16_1_two_mirror`**: Run full 160,000-combination sweep on `test_s16_1_two_mirror.tres`. All 29 invariants checked at every combination. Expected: zero failures. Validates: all invariants hold at scale for simple reflection.

7. **`test_stage65_custom_positions_included`**: Verify that per-level `test_positions` are tested as both player and cursor positions, in addition to the 20x20 grid. Expected: total combinations > 160,000 when custom positions are present. Validates: custom position coverage.
8. **`test_stage65_failure_report_format`**: Inject a known invariant violation (e.g., NaN in output). Expected: failure report includes player_pos, cursor_pos, plan, invariant ID ("S16"), actual value ("NaN"), expected condition ("finite"). Validates: report quality.
9. **`test_stage65_UX1_cursor_in_visibility`**: Across all sweep positions where cursor is inside the visibility region: verify no divergence occurs in the trace. Expected: zero violations. Validates: UX1 at scale.
10. **`test_stage65_UX2_divergence_outside_visibility`**: Across all sweep positions where divergence occurs: verify cursor is outside the visibility region. Expected: zero violations. Validates: UX2 at scale.
11. **`test_stage65_UX3_preview_matches_flight`**: For a sample of 1,000 sweep positions with non-red preview: fire the arrow and compare flight path to preview. Expected: identical paths. Validates: UX3 at scale.
12. **`test_stage65_UX4_determinism`**: For a sample of 1,000 sweep positions: run the same trace twice. Expected: identical step trees both times. Validates: UX4 at scale.
13. **`test_stage65_UX5_undo_restores`**: For the state-change test level, fire a shot, undo. Expected: full state restoration (player position, game state flags, targets). Validates: UX5.
14. **`test_stage65_UX6_targets_reachable`**: For each test level with targets: verify there exists at least one (player_pos, cursor_pos) in the sweep that hits all targets (possibly across multiple shots). Validates: UX6.
15. **`test_stage65_UX7_solid_path`**: Across all sweep positions: if a preview is generated, it starts as a solid segment from the player toward the cursor. Expected: zero violations. Validates: UX7.
16. **`test_stage65_UX11_empty_plan_straight`**: Across all sweep positions with empty plan: fire direction is a straight line from player toward cursor. Expected: zero violations. Validates: UX11.
17. **`test_stage65_S16_no_nan_inf`**: Across ALL 160,000+ combinations: no NaN or Inf values appear anywhere in the step tree, visibility regions, or preview data. Expected: zero violations. Validates: S16 at exhaustive scale.
18. **`test_stage65_S18_determinant_nonzero`**: Across all sweep positions: every Mobius frame matrix encountered during tracing has non-zero determinant. Expected: zero violations. Validates: S18 at scale.
19. **`test_stage65_UX1_UX2_varying_plans`**: For each test level and a subset of (player, cursor) pairs (100 pairs): test with the empty plan AND with each single-surface plan (one entry per interactive surface side). UX1 and UX2 must hold for ALL plans, not just the fixed plan. Validates: UX1/UX2 across plan space.
20. **`test_stage65_fuzz_optional`**: Generate 1000 random (player, cursor) pairs within level bounds. Check all 29 invariants for each. Expected: zero violations. *(Optional for CI, required for release.)*

> **Note:** This test extends the fixed-plan sweep to cover the combinatorial plan space. While exhaustive coverage of all possible plans is computationally prohibitive, testing the empty plan plus all single-entry plans provides good coverage of plan-dependent UX invariants.

**Edge case note:** If a level has many pass-through surfaces, the physical trace may hit the 256-hit limit while the planned trace (which skips pass-throughs in image chains) has few steps. This causes divergence due to the hit limit, not geometry. The sweep should verify that this divergence correctly triggers UX2 (divergence → outside visibility) rather than producing an inconsistent state.

**Performance budget:** The full sweep (20x20 x 20x20 = 160K combinations per level) targets completion in under 10 minutes per level on a mid-range CPU. For CI/quick verification, a reduced sweep (5x5 x 5x5 = 625 combinations) is acceptable. The test infrastructure should support a `--quick-sweep` flag that uses the reduced grid. Full sweeps are required for release verification only.

**Test position strategy:** In addition to the 20x20 grid and per-level `test_positions`, add epsilon-offset positions near visibility boundaries. For each surface endpoint (x,y), include (x+0.01, y) and (x-0.01, y) as test positions. These catch narrow boundary transitions the grid spacing might miss.

**Optional fuzz test mode:** In addition to the grid sweep, an optional fuzz test generates random player/cursor positions within level bounds and checks all invariants. Run for a configurable time limit (e.g., 60 seconds). Enable with `--fuzz` flag. Low-effort, high-value for finding edge cases the regular grid misses.

### Interactive User Tests

- [ ] Run the full sweep test suite from GUT. (Note: this will take significant time -- potentially minutes.) GUT reports pass/fail per test level.
- [ ] If any failures occur, examine the failure report output. Verify it contains: player position, cursor position, plan state, which invariant failed, actual vs expected values.
- [ ] Verify that the sweep covers the full 20x20 x 20x20 grid (check test output for "160,000 combinations tested" or similar).
- [ ] Verify custom positions are included (test output mentions additional positions beyond the grid).
- [ ] All 29 invariants show as tested in the sweep report summary.

### Invariants That Must Hold

This stage validates ALL 29 invariants at scale. Every invariant transitions to "fully testable" status.

### Failure Mode Tests

The following tests verify graceful degradation under error conditions:

1. **`test_failure_invariant_violation_release`**: In release mode, trigger an invariant violation (e.g., force a NaN into a point coordinate). Expected: error logged, computation skips the problematic step, no crash. Validates: S31.8 release error handling.

2. **`test_failure_corrupted_tres_graceful`**: Load a `.tres` file with invalid surface data (e.g., zero-length segment). Expected: validation catches it at load, error reported, level not loaded. Validates: S23 constraints + S31.8.

3. **`test_failure_256_limit_in_planned_trace`**: Plan causes the planned trace to accumulate 256 steps (many pass-throughs in sequence). Expected: trace terminates cleanly, truncation marker shown. Validates: S12.6 in planned mode.

4. **`test_failure_degenerate_mobius_determinant`**: Construct a MobiusTransform with near-zero determinant (|ad-bg|^2 near machine epsilon but still positive). Apply it to a point. Expected: result is finite (no division-by-near-zero blowup). Validates: S31 numerical stability.

5. **`test_failure_missing_state_key_no_default`**: CategoricalResolver with state_key not in game_state, and no DEFAULT key in config_table. Expected: falls back to first entry in table. Warning logged in debug builds. Validates: S9.4 missing key behavior.

6. **`test_stage65_invariant_checker_catches_violation`**: Intentionally inject a known invariant violation (e.g., set a Step's frame_id to a value different from the planned trace's frame_id, violating S5). Run the invariant checker on this corrupted step tree. Expected: the checker reports the S5 violation with correct details (which invariant, which step, expected vs actual). Validates: the invariant checker itself is correct — not just that the code doesn't violate invariants.

7. **`test_stage65_checker_catches_S13_violation`**: Inject a self-intersecting visibility region. Expected: checker reports S13 violation.
8. **`test_stage65_checker_catches_UX1_violation`**: Place cursor inside visibility but inject a divergence. Expected: checker reports UX1 violation.
9. **`test_stage65_checker_catches_S4_violation`**: Re-converge after divergence (monotonicity violation). Expected: checker reports S4 violation.
10. **`test_stage65_checker_catches_S7_violation`**: Inject a state mismatch between planner's state_at[i] and physical trace's game state at step i. Expected: checker reports S7 violation.
11. **`test_stage65_checker_catches_S19_violation`**: Modify real GameState during a preview trace (break copy isolation). Expected: checker reports S19 violation.
12. **`test_stage65_checker_catches_UX3_violation`**: Make the physical trace produce a different path than the preview showed. Expected: checker reports UX3 violation.
13. **`test_stage65_checker_catches_S2_violation`**: Break a transform round-trip (apply then inverse returns different Point ID). Expected: checker reports S2 violation.

14. **`test_stage65_debug_assert_fires`**: In debug mode, trigger a condition that should fire an assert (e.g., create a MobiusTransform with zero determinant). Expected: the assert fires and is caught by the test framework. Validates: §31.8 debug-mode crash behavior — asserts actually fire, not just silently pass.

15. **`test_stage65_checkpoint_memory_bounded`**: Fire 100 shots (accumulating 100 checkpoints). Measure memory usage (via Godot's Performance monitor or OS.get_static_memory_usage()). Expected: memory growth is approximately linear in checkpoint count — no unexpected quadratic growth from deep-copy aliasing. *(Sanity check, not a hard limit.)*

## Stage 66: Performance Optimization

### Overview
Profile the preview computation pipeline and optimize to meet the target of less than 5ms per preview update on a mid-range CPU. Implement incremental recomputation (reuse unchanged steps when only the cursor moves), frame transform caching, batch math via `PackedFloat64Array`, and spatial indexing for levels with many surfaces. All optimizations must preserve every invariant -- verified by re-running the full sweep from Stage 65.

If the full sweep (Stage 65) exceeds the 10-minute-per-level budget, consider moving the intersection kernel to a GDExtension (C++) module. The math layer's zero-Godot-dependency design makes this migration straightforward (S20.1).

### Prerequisites
Stage 65 (invariant sweep provides the regression baseline for verifying optimizations are correctness-preserving).

### What Is Introduced

| Category | Item | Spec Reference |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Script | `scripts/math/batch_intersection.gd` -- PackedFloat64Array-based batch intersection kernel | §20.1 |
| Script | `scripts/math/spatial_index.gd` -- grid or BVH spatial index for surface lookup | §30.2 |
| Behavior | Incremental recomputation: if only cursor moved, recompute from last unchanged step | §30.3 |
| Behavior | Frame transform caching: avoid recomputing M^-1 for unchanged frames | §30.3 |
| Behavior | PackedFloat64Array for hot loops (intersection kernel: 256 steps x N surfaces) | §20.1 |
| Behavior | Spatial indexing when N > 100 surfaces | §30.2 |
| Behavior | Target: preview computation < 5ms on mid-range CPU | §30.1 |

### Unit Tests Added

1. **`test_stage66_incremental_recompute_same_result`**: Compute a full trace. Move cursor slightly. Compute incremental trace. Expected: results are identical to a fresh full trace at the new cursor position. Validates: incremental correctness.
2. **`test_stage66_incremental_recompute_partial`**: Set up a 5-step trace. Move cursor such that only the last 2 steps change. Expected: incremental recompute only recomputes 2 steps (verified by instrumentation counter). First 3 steps are reused. Validates: §30.3 incremental reuse.

### Interactive User Tests

- [ ] Play a level with 10+ surfaces. Move the cursor rapidly. Preview updates smoothly with no visible lag or stutter.
- [ ] Open the Godot profiler (Debugger > Profiler). Observe the preview computation function. Verify it stays under 5ms per frame on average.
- [ ] Play a level with the cursor stationary. Move it slightly. Verify the preview updates are faster than a full recompute (check profiler -- incremental path should be shorter).
- [ ] Create a test level in the editor with 100+ surfaces (stress test). Play in test mode. Verify preview still updates at interactive frame rates (>30fps).
- [ ] Play through all 6 worked example test levels after optimization. Verify behavior is identical to pre-optimization (same bounces, same divergence, same everything).

### Invariants That Must Hold

| Invariant ID | Description | How Verified | New This Stage? |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| ALL (S1--S19, UX1--UX11) | All 29 invariants | Full Stage 65 sweep re-run after optimization | Inherited (regression) |

### Regression Checklist

| Prior Stage | Behavior | How to Verify |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Stage 65 | Full invariant sweep passes | Re-run sweep (test_stage66_sweep_regression) |
| Stage 64 | All worked example tests pass | Run Stage 64 tests |
| Stage 63 | Editor validation and test mode | Use editor |
| Stage 62 | Serialization | Save/load level |
| Stage 61 | Surface placement | Create surfaces |
| Stage 60 | Full game loop | Play a level |

### Expected Visual State

## Stage 67: Visual Polish

### Overview
Apply all visual polish specified in the design document: surface side indicators with per-side coloring, arrow visuals with tangent-following rotation, target animations (pulse/glow for unhit, dimmer with checkmark for hit), hit event flashes, truncation markers, escape ray rendering, placeholder sounds, line widths, z-ordering, and step tree draw ordering. This is the final stage -- after this, the game is visually complete.

Escape ray rendering for the PREVIEW was introduced in Stage 15. This stage adds the flight-animation-specific behavior: during arrow flight, when the arrow reaches an escape step, it flies to the viewport edge and disappears (§21.3).

### Prerequisites
Stage 66 (performance optimized, all invariants verified -- visual polish must not break correctness).

### What Is Introduced

### Interactive User Tests **[BEHAVIORAL -- USER SIGN-OFF REQUIRED]**

- [ ] Play a level. Surfaces show dual-colored side indicators (left color and right color visible as separate strips).
- [ ] Observe a surface with one non-interactive side. That side is visibly dimmer (50% opacity).
- [ ] Fire an arrow. The arrow visual is a line with a triangular head, rotating to follow the path direction.
- [ ] Arrow bounces off a curved surface. Arrow head rotates smoothly to follow the arc tangent.
- [ ] Observe an unhit target. It pulses or glows.
- [ ] Hit a target with an arrow. Target dims and shows a checkmark.
- [ ] Fire an arrow that bounces. At each bounce point, a brief flash is visible.
- [ ] Fire a shot that causes a state change (breaks a wall). The wall visually updates at the moment of impact during the flight animation.
- [ ] Create a scenario with 256+ potential hits (if possible). Observe the truncation marker (stop icon) at the final hit.
- [ ] Fire an arrow that escapes (no surface in path). Arrow flies to the viewport edge and disappears.
- [ ] Listen for sounds: fire (on click), bounce (at each reflection), break (wall break), target_hit (target hit), level_complete (all targets hit).
- [ ] Verify surface line thickness appears heavier (3px) than trajectory lines (2px).
- [ ] Verify layering: surfaces behind visibility regions, visibility behind preview, preview behind arrow, arrow behind player.
- [ ] Fire an arrow where the preview shows multiple step types. Verify the draw order: diverged planned paths are behind aligned paths, which are behind diverged physical paths.

- Arrow is a 40-unit line with a triangular head that rotates to follow path tangent along both straight and curved segments.
- Unhit targets pulse with a gentle glow. Hit targets are dimmed with checkmark overlays.
- Bounce points flash briefly during arrow flight animation.
- State-change surfaces update visually at the moment of impact.
- Escaped arrows render a line to the viewport edge and vanish.
- If truncation occurs, a stop icon marks the final point.
- Z-ordering is correct: surfaces are the bottom layer, visibility on top, then preview, arrow on top of preview, player on top of everything.
- Step tree branches are drawn in correct back-to-front order.
- All game events produce appropriate placeholder sounds.

## Post-Implementation: Visual Regression Testing

**Future Enhancement (§29.5):** Screenshot comparison for known test scenes at known player/cursor positions should be implemented as a post-launch quality gate. Each test level should have a reference screenshot. The test captures a screenshot at the same position and compares pixel-by-pixel with a tolerance threshold. This catches rendering bugs (wrong arc direction, missing segments, incorrect colors) that unit tests cannot detect.

This is not a blocking requirement for initial implementation but should be added before release.

---

## Open Design Decisions (§33)

The following spec features are intentionally deferred per GAME_SPEC.md §33 and have no TDD stages: level progression structure, scoring/par system, art direction beyond wireframe, sound design/audio architecture, advanced editor features (undo/redo, multi-select, snap-to-grid), settings rebinding, multiplayer, mobile/touch input, accessibility, localization, level load transitions, plan undo (Ctrl+Z), gamepad plan construction, moving/animated surfaces, and Godot signal architecture. These are content/product design decisions, not engine requirements.

§3.2 opt-in failure conditions (e.g., a breakable surface that cannot be restored) are a per-level content design feature, not an engine requirement. No TDD stage implements this. When needed, add `LevelData.failure_condition` and corresponding game manager logic.
